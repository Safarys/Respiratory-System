The Respiratory Diagnostics Management System is designed to operate in the healthcare domain, particularly in pulmonary medicine, emphasizing improving diagnostic processes and patient care. It assists healthcare professionals in offering accurate respiratory disease diagnosis tools, secure management of patient data, and telemedicine consultations. Deep Learning is the main function of the system as it is a trustworthy second opinion for doctors, hence it provides precise and consistent lung sound analysis. This functionality complements the expertise of physicians rather than replacing it, allowing for more confident decision-making. In addition, telemedicine is designed for rural or underprivileged areas also for those who have migrated to new locations. These patients, who trust doctors from their original regions, can now maintain continuity of care and seek consultations remotely with their trusted physicians through the platform.
This project integrates the latest technologies to provide  diagnostic capabilities. Deep Learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), forms the core of the system. The system is able to classify lung sounds into categories such as wheezes, crackles, and normal breathing patterns with the help of automated classification. The platform has been built using the Python Django framework for its web-based interface, ensuring scalability and ease of use. MySQL is used as the database to store the patient's information securely, such as medical history, diagnostic reports, and follow-up schedules. The combination of these technologies will ensure real-time processing, secure data management, and seamless remote diagnostics, with consistent and reliable results for healthcare professionals.
This System is a significant step forward in pulmonary medicine, addressing some of the critical challenges in diagnostic accuracy and accessibility. The system increases the confidence of healthcare professionals with Deep Learning as a second opinion. The telemedicine feature bridges geographical gaps to ensure that patients, including those who have migrated, can access healthcare from trusted providers. This is a comprehensive platform that not only simplifies diagnostic workflows but also trust, reliability, and continuity in healthcare services. With its intuitive design and scalable framework, the system is well-positioned to revolutionize respiratory care, ensuring better outcomes and improved quality of healthcare delivery.
